## About the Librelio Magazine Solution
The Librelio Magazine Solution is intended mainly for magazine publishers. It consists in:
- customizable mobile apps: a complete version has been developed on iOS, [Android](https://github.com/libreliodev/android) and Windows 8(here).
- a cloud based server

Examples of apps developed using this solution are listed on www.librelio.com. A good example of iOS app is the [Wind magazine app](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/wind-magazine/id433594605?mt=8). 

## Purpose of this project
This project aims at porting the existing iOS customizable app to Windows 8.
